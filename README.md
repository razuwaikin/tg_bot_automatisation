# ls-club-informator

Little shiny telegram bot on telebot, that give you information about your club infrastructure. 

./example/ClubDB.json - contain example data for work

By default telegram bot doesnt work, but if you uncomment 10-11 lines in docker-compose.yml this will work.
You need to do a correct mount to your "Database file".

Best regards!
